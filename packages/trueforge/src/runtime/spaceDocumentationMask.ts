/**
 * Masks regions of a body where a literal `<!-- @block:… -->` is documentation text, not a
 * structural marker: fenced code blocks (``` / ~~~) and <pre>/<code> elements. Masked
 * characters become spaces, so offsets into the masked body match the original body and the
 * marker regex can run on it directly.
 *
 * This is fail-closed by construction: without masking, a fenced sample documenting the
 * marker syntax would parse as a real addressable block, and an edit_space call could
 * silently destroy everything after it — the exact fail-open class the reliability work
 * exists to eliminate. An unclosed fence or tag masks to the end of the body.
 *
 * Single O(n) line pass with indexOf-based tag counting: no nested quantifiers, so this
 * cannot reintroduce the backtracking the anchor pattern was fixed for.
